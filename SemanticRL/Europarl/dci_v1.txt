As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.

It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI.

the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received.

The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

PDSCH Frequency domain Resource Allocation Types.

if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ).

active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part.

As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.

PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.

The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment.

The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

PDSCH Frequency domain Resource Allocation Types.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Mapping of PDSCH to HARQ feedback timing indicator field values to numbers of slots.
----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.

Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.

The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment.

The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

PDSCH Frequency domain Resource Allocation Types.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI.

The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received.

The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure,

Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.

For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.

It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI.

the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order.

the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part.

and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.

PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.

The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list.

The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

PDSCH Frequency domain Resource Allocation Types.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

PDSCH Frequency domain Resource Allocation Types.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received.

The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.

The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part.

PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.

The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

PDSCH Frequency domain Resource Allocation Types.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

When New Data Indicator is toggled in DCI. 
it implies new downlink data. 
Toggling NDI in uplink grant informs UE to send new data.
New Data Indicator bit will also be set to indicate.
this will be new data and the receive buffer should be flushed before loading the user data.

pdsch to harq feedback timing indicator.
Indicates the moment when the UE sents a PUCCH with a HARQ ACK message.
----------------------------------------------------
PDSCH to HARQ feedback timing indicator is a three bits value sent in DCI message.
In the case of DCI Format 1_0. 
three bits in the PDSCH to HARQ feedback timing indicator are mapped to K one values from one to eight.

For DCI format 1_0, 
the PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator field values map to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. 
For DCI format 1_1, if present, 
the PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator field values map to values for a set of number of slots provided by downlink Data to uplink ack.
Mapping of PDSCH to HARQ feedback timing indicator field values to numbers of slots.

PUCCH transmission with HARQ ACK information is subject to the limitations for UE transmissions.
Mapping of PDSCH to HARQ feedback timing indicator field values to numbers of slots.
----------------------------------------------------
Time domain resource assignment is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI.
the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission occasion. 
and the resource allocation in the time domain.
As discussed in the post: Time Domain Slots and Slot Formats. 
number of slots available for transmission varies depending upon the network configuration. 
Therefore, it is important for the network to signal the UE about the timing of data transmission.
Signalling of time domain resources means. 
informing the UE about which slots the data can be transmitted/received. Similar to LTE. 
NR resource allocation is done either dynamically or in semi persistent manner.
Dynamic scheduling in the uplink is done using PDCCH DCI. 
For semi persistent scheduling, NR defines two mechanisms. 
one using PDCCH DCI (similar to LTE) and the other one purely via RRC signalling (new in NR).
PDCCH DCI is used for both dynamic and Semi Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in the downlink (similar to LTE).
Time domain PUSCH resource allocation is discussed in the post. 
PUSCH Resource Allocation in Time Domain. 
In this post, downlink (PDSCH) resource allocation in time domain is discussed in detail.
Time Domain Allocation List is configured by either pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config.
The IE pdsch TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. 
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List contains one or more (up to 16) of such pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocations.
The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. 
Value zero in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list. 
value one in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.
The bit width of the DCI field is based on the number of entries in the pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List.
pdsch Time Domain Resource Allocation List IE structure is shown below. 
It contains K0, PDSCH mapping type, and start Symbol And Length.
where the number of bits of Time domain resource assignment depends on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space, whether the upper level configures pdsch Time Domain Allocation List in IE pdsch Config Common or pdsch Config related. 
if pdsch If pdsch Time Domain Allocation List is configured in ConfigCommon or pdsch Config. 
the UE uses pdsch Time Domain Allocation List to determine the time domain resources. 
otherwise the UE uses the default time domain resource table based on RNTI. 
PDCCH search space and other information. 
The default time domain resource list is used by UE to look up the table.

DCI formats 1_0 and 1_1 carries four bits field named time domain resource assignment which points to one of the rows of a look up table. 
How the UE determines which look up table to be used.
There can be up to sixteen rows in the look up table and hence only four bits are used for the field time domain resource assignment.
Each row in the look up table provides the following parameters.
This parameter is used to derive the slot in which PDSCH reception occurs. 
When K0 = 0, PDSCH reception is intended within the same slot where DCI is received. 
When allocation and PDSCH transmission are contained in the same slot. 
it is referred to as self contained slot.
SLIV (jointly coded start and length indicator values).
SLIV or individual values for the start symbol S and the allocation length L.

----------------------------------------------------
HARQ process number is a four bits value sent in DCI message.
for downlink, sixteen harq processes per cell is supported by the ue.
this value points to one of the sixteen harq processes.

DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number.
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission or reception of the HARQ data.
DCI Format 1-0 and 1-1 for downlink scheduling assignment contains HARQ related information as.
Hybrid ARQ process number is four bits. 
informing the device about the hybrid ARQ process to use for soft combining.
To analyze HARQ process. 
the first thing you need to do is to identify a specific HARQ number and follow through all the steps with the same HARQ process number. 
In this example. 
I marked HARQ process number with different color.
The gNB sends a scheduling message to the UE indicating resources to be used for uplink transmission. 
which also has HARQ process number. 
The UE will follow the order and send the transport block (or Codeblock group) as per the scheduling grant. 
The gNB will calculate and verify the checksum for the correctness of the message. 
The gNB will order the UE to retransmit the transport block again with a new scheduling grant. 
if an error id detected. 
In order to indicate a retransmission is required. 
same HARQ process number is sent with NDI bit set to no. 
which will be interpreted by the UE as retransmission.     
In LTE HARQ. 
downlink use Asynchronous mechanism but Uplink uses Synchronous mechanism. 
In contrast.
in NR both downlink and Uplink Asynchronous mechanism is used. 
(For the definition of Ascynchronous HARQ and Synchronous HARQ, refer to LTE HARQ). 
Just to give you an practical aspect of Asynchronous HARQ. 
it operates the multiple HARQ processes in any order. 
To keep track of each HARQ process even when they are not running in order. 
the sender and reciever in the HARQ process should know the exact HARQ process number for each transmission/reception of the HARQ data. 
For this, DCI carries the field called HARQ Processor number. 
In LTE, only the DCI for downlink scheduling (i.e, DCI 1, DCI 2 etc) carries this field (since LTE DL use Asynchronous HARQ) and the DCI for uplink schedule(i.e, DCI 0) does not carry this field(since LTE UL use Synchronous HARQ). 
However in NR, both Downlink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 1_0, 1_1) and Uplink Scheduling DCI (i.e, DCI 0_0, 0_1) carries the field HARQ Processor Number since they both use Asychronous HARQ.

frequency domain resource assignment represents variable with downlink bandwidth part numbers of resource block.
Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are supported. The UE shall assume that when the
scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1 is used. 
If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource allocation type as part of the Frequency domain
resource assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter resource Allocation in pdsch Config to 'dynamicswitch',
the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use
the downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer parameter resource Allocation.
If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling DCI or the UE does not support active BWP
change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within the UE's
active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is determined within
the UE's bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. 
The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the downlink carrier bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the bandwidth part.
For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1_0 in any type of PDCCH common search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the DCI was received. 
otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the determined downlink bandwidth part. 

PDSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Time Domain Resource Allocation is thoroughly discussed in the post: ‘PDSCH Resource Allocation in Time-Domain’.
Signalling of frequency domain resources means, informing the UE about resource blocks (RBs) and the corresponding bandwidth part (BWP) on which the intended data to be transmitted/received. 
Using the allocated frequency resources, the UE transmits/receives the data on PUSCH/PDSCH.
The post, Bandwidth Parts thoroughly discusses about BWP allocation and this post discusses PDSCH resource allocation in frequency domain in detail. 
For uplink resource allocation, refer to the post: PUSCH Resource Allocation in Frequency Domain.
Frequency domain resource allocation concept in NR is almost similar to that of LTE, except for the fact that NR frequency resources are allocated per BWP whereas in LTE, 
the resource allocation is done over entire carrier bandwidth.
The network informs the UE about the frequency resources to be used for the reception of PDSCH using DCI Formats 1_0, 1_1 or 1_2. Within these DCI Formats, the field ‘Frequency domain resource assignment’ carries the required resource allocation information.

PDSCH Frequency domain Resource Allocation Types.

Understanding the Heart of the 5G Air Interface. 
An Overview of Physical Downlink Control Channel for 5G New Radio.
New Radio (NR) is a new radio air interface developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for
the fifth generation (5G) mobile communications system. 
With great flexibility, scalability, 
and efficiency, 5G is expected to address a wide range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications
(URLLC), and massive machine type communications (mMTC).
The physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) in NR carries Downlink Control Information (DCI). Understanding how
PDCCH operates is key to developing a good understanding of how information is communicated over NR. 
This paper provides an overview of the 5G NR PDCCH by describing its physical layer structure, 
monitoring mechanisms, beamforming operation, and the carried information. We also share various design rationales that influence NR standardization.
